The kind of thing you build when you need a thing built to build other things around it.

How to Run
======

Make sure you have all the pre-requisites:

```
npm install -g webpack
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=app.py
npm install
```

Then in two separate windows run `webpack -w` and  `flask run`.
